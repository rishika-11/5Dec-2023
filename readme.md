# FLOWER RECOGNITION

# Overview
The repository contains code for the flower recognition using data set.The data set contains 4242 images of flowers.The images are divided into five classes: daisy, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. For each class, there are approximately 800 photos. The photos are not in high resolution, approximately 320Ã—240 pixels.The project is to  recognize the images using deep learning.

# Model Architecture
It initializes a sequential convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras, comprising a 2D convolutional layer with 64 filters, a filter size of (3,3), 'same' padding, and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation. This is followed by a flatten layer to transform the convolutional output into a one-dimensional vector, and a dense layer with 5 neurons and softmax activation, suitable for multi-class classification tasks. The model is designed to process input images with dimensions (128, 128, 3), where 128 represents the spatial dimensions, and 3 corresponds to the RGB color channels. This architecture is commonly employed for image classification, particularly in scenarios involving multiple classes.
The code compiles a neural network model using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001, categorical crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. It then trains the model for 7 epochs using data augmentation applied by datagen.flow on the training set (X_train, y_train) with a batch size of 32, while validating on the test set (X_test, y_test). The training progress and validation results are stored in the history variable for further analysis or visualization.
